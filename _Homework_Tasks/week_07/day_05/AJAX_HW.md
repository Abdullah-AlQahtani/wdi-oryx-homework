# Get comfortable with AJAX and APIs

Build a website that uses both AJAX and APIs. It's up to you to choose both the design and the functionality, though we have a suggestion (below).

If you don't feel like doing something with the ISS, find an API [here](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis). **Note**, don't pick an API that has the word **OAuth** next to it (yet).

## International Space Station (ISS) Location

Using the [ISS Space Location API](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/), create a website that tracks the current position of the ISS.

To begin with, using AJAX, show the current latitude and longitude on the screen.

### Bonus 1

Update the latitude and longitude every second (this is a process called **polling**).

### Bonus 2

Show the current position of the ISS as a [marker](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/markers) on a [Google Map](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial). Note, you can also use a [custom marker](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/custom-markers)!

### Bonus 3

Show the current position of the ISS as a marker on a [Google Map](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial), and use [polylines](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/shapes#polylines) to represent where it has been (since the page was loaded).
