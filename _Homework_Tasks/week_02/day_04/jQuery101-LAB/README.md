# Angry Birds!

For homework this week we are going to practice working with JSON objects and using them to modify the DOM.  I've included starter files with a few HTML elements in the index.html file.  Make sure you look there first to see what is given!

Once you have familiarized yourself with the starter code, you'll find the questions in the main.js file.  Be sure to reference the JSON review exercise we did in class on Thursday as well as the SWAPI codealong.  They may be helpful!
