# Title: Guess The Number

## Activity:

- You are to generate a basic "guess my number" game. The computer will pick a random number between 0 and 10. The user will keep guessing the number until they guess correctly.

## Specification:

- The user should be asked to guess a number
- If the user's guess is correct, the user should see a congratulatory message (e.g. "Well done, you got it right")
- If the user's guess is not correct, the user should be asked to guess the number again. (e.g. "Sorry, that's not the right number")

## Extensions:

- Let the user choose the maximum value (so they can play a long game with a random value between 0 and 10000, for example).
- Give feedback to the user: "Wrong, guess higher!" or "Wrong, guess lower!"
