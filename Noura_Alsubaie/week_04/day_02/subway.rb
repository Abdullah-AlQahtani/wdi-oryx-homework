# there are  three lines (and lines are  arrays inside a hash)
#  Within those lines (arrays) there are strings representing stations
#  The user will give a starting station and an ending station
#  starting station and ending sataion are indexes of those arrayes
# to get there use each do 
# two cases of starting staion 
# If the starting station is later in the line than the ending station
# use case method for that 
#  two indexes need to do a for loop.
